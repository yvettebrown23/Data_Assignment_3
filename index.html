    <p> When COVID-19 hit the United States, it spread rapidly.  The number of those infected were multiplying each week.  After mask and vaccine mandates were put in place, we began to see a decrease in those numbers until the Delta and Omicron variants came about. </p>
    <p> The Omicron variant, the one that was most recently detected, originated in Botswana on Nov. 11, and quickly spread through South Africa by Nov. 14.  According to the CDC, “despite the increased attention of Omicron, Delta continues to be the main variant circulating the United States.” </p>
    <p> The CDC says that the Omicron variant is more likely to spread easier than COVID-19, but it’s still unknown on how quickly it spreads compared to the Delta variant. </p>
    <p> According to the New York Governor’s website, 21,027 positive cases were reported in New York alone, as of Dec. 17. </p>
    <p> “The vaccine is still our best weapon to defeat the virus and ensure we are safe from serious illness,” said NY Gov. Kathy Hochul.   “Get the shot if you haven't yet and the booster if you have, mask up, and wash your hands." </p>
